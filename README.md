# URI-templates

This contains implementations for Java, JavaScript, and Python.  The implementation for IDL is in progress and should be available soon.

The files `formatting.json` and `parsing.json` can be used to run unit tests on code that implements the specification.

A useful time utilities library, TimeUtil.java, is found at https://github.com/hapi-server/client-java/blob/master/src/org/hapiserver/TimeUtil.java 
and its use is shown in unit tests at https://github.com/uri-templates-time/uri-templates/blob/master/UriTemplatesJava/test/org/hapiserver/TimeUtilTest.java.
